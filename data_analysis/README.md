# data analysis
This part is for scripts that extract information about the datasets used.

## background traffic analysis
The background does both consist of unparsed Twitch data, which can be usefull if rds-collect will be used more in the future (so one can analyse the data, and remove unnecesary parts, before making the trouble of parsing it).

### create_background_dataset.py
Creates a subset of traffic from dtaset generated from the rds-collect. Can be usefull if one will generate more data from that tool, to remove unwanted parts. 

### rds_collect_analysis.py
Graphs of dataset generated by rds-collect, with an empathis on packets per second

### rds_collect_analysis_table.py
Statistic table for a dataset, generated by rds-collect


## foreground analysis
with the code foreground_analysis.py, one can get a table of packets per second interval for all (or induvidual files) of the foreground dataset. Have been used to find delays at the start of foreground datasets. 


## Merged dataset analysis
The merged dataset, can be analyzed for overhead, by runing analyze_all_merged.py, which will analyse all files in a directory. The analysis is performed by merged_analysis.py
